Devel-Command version 0.04
==========================

Devel::Command is used to automatically find and load debugger command
extension modules. It provides functions to allow these modules to register 
themselves in the debugger %DB::commands global. 

It also provides a sample .perldb containing a modified version of the
debugger's DB::DB subroutine, altered to provide the necessary command 
hooks.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then place the following in your .perldb file (or equivalent on
your platform):

   use Devel::Command;

That's it. Devel::Command will find all of the command plugins
in the Devel::Command:: namespace and load them for you.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Module::Pluggable, Test::More

The substitute debugger command loop contained in this module
is compatible with Perl 5.8.6; it may or may not work with
earlier or later Perls. If this module is of use to you, please
write to me; I will lobby to have this functionality be part of
the core debugger if there's enough interest.
