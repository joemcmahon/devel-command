Devel-Command version 0.07
==========================

Devel::Command is used to automatically find and load debugger command
extension modules, automatically patching the debugger to enable them.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then place the following in your .perldb file (or equivalent on
your platform):

   use Devel::Command;

That's it. Devel::Command will find all of the command plugins
in the Devel::Command:: namespace and load them for you.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Module::Pluggable, Test::More

The debugger patch plugins provided with this version of Devel::Command
will handle any version of Perl 5.6 and Perl 5.8. If your Perl is not
supported by this module, and it can handle Module::Pluggable, please
write me at mcmahon@cpan.org and I will create a new patch module for it.
